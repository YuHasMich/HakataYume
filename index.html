  <!-- Narrative Text -->
  <p>
    I was at the Shikaumi Shrine in the summer of 1970. The monk in the picture (on the left in the white robe) and the other man on the right came down the steps. The monk touched me on my head—gently tousled my hair a bit. But the strange thing was I had the impression that he had an aura, better described as he seemed to be illuminated from within. I had the impression that something transpired between us. That experience has never left me.

    In Japan, there is a phrase, ichigo ichie (一期一会), meaning “one time, one meeting.” It speaks to the beauty of fleeting moments, encouraging us to treasure each encounter as something unique and precious. That moment at Shikaumi Shrine was my ichigo ichie—a brief and quiet meeting that continues to resonate in my life.
